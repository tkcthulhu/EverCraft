#May your C's stay Sharp
(I am funny)

Another dive into TDD in C# using Visual Studio, this is one of my favorite project to use for learning a new language due to just the sheer volume of code written. 
Between tests and adding properties and methods and constatnly fixing logic there just isn't a better project to really dive in to a new language with, I've 
been looking for a reason to build this again and with the object oriented approach C# is perfect for this!
